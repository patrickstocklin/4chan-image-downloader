Simple and dirty Python script to download all images from a 4chan thread. Handy for wallpapers.

For now it saves them in a folder using a specific directory that is hard-coded by me. Will fix later...

Libraries: BeautifulSoup, urllib/urllib2, os, sys

```Use: python 4chanImageDownloader <url>```
