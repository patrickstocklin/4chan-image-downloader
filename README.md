Simple and dirty Python script to download all images from a 4chan thread. Handy for wallpapers.

First, open the .py file in a text editor and change the directory to a folder you would like to save all the images to:

Then you may simply run it as follows, copying and pasting the thread URL:
```python 4chanImageDownloader.py <url>```

Libraries: BeautifulSoup, urllib/urllib2, os, sys (all should already be installed, with the exception of BeautifulSoup)
